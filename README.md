# Submission Instructions
- This assignment is to be completed by groups of four students each.
- For each group, a repository should be created on Github. The repository should
have all group members set up as contributors.
- All assignments must be uploaded to a GitHub repository. Students who haven't
pushed any codes to the repository will not be given the opportunity to present and
defend the assignment. More particularly, if a student’s username does not appear
in the commit log of the group repository, that student will be assumed not to have
contributed to the project and thus be awarded the mark 0.
- The assignment will be group work, but individual marks will be allocated based on
each student's contribution to the assignment.
- Marks for the assignment will only be allocated to students who have presented the
assignment.
- It’s the responsibility of all group members to make sure that they are available for
the assignment presentation. An assignment cannot be presented more than once.
- The submission date is Wednesday, October 25, 2023, at midnight. Please note
that commits after that deadline will not be accepted. Therefore, a submission will be
assessed based on the clone of the repository at the deadline.
- Any group that fails to submit on time will be awarded the mark 0. Late Submission
will not be considered.
- There should be no assumption about the execution environment of your code. It
could be run using a specific framework or on the command line.
